## Global Population Report 2024


The Global Population Report 2024 provides a comprehensive analysis of worldwide demographic patterns using data on population distribution, age composition, gender ratio, and density. This project focuses on identifying global trends such as population growth, aging demographics, and regional disparities. The dataset has been analyzed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to uncover meaningful insights and visualize global population structures.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains country-wise demographic data for the year 2024. It includes the following key attributes:

Column Name	Description
Country	Name of the country
Population (in millions)	Total population of the country in millions
Population Aged 0 to 14 (%)	Percentage of population aged between 0 and 14 years
Population Aged 60 and Over (%)	Percentage of population aged 60 years and above
Female Population (in millions)	Total female population in millions
Male Population (in millions)	Total male population in millions
Sex Ratio (males per 100 females)	Number of males per 100 females
Population Density	Number of people per square kilometer

The dataset can be used for comparative population analysis, demographic forecasting, and educational or research purposes.

Objectives

To explore and analyze the population structure of different countries in 2024.

To visualize the relationships between demographic factors such as age distribution, population density, and gender ratio.

To identify global trends in population growth and aging.

To support data-driven insights for research, policy, and learning purposes.

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

Methodology

Data Cleaning: Handled missing or inconsistent values, formatted numerical data, and standardized country names.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated descriptive statistics and summary metrics for all columns.

Visualization: Created graphs and charts (bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps) to represent population distributions and relationships between key variables.

Correlation Analysis: Examined how factors like age distribution and population density influence total population and gender ratios.

Insights and Findings

Countries with higher aging populations tend to have lower population growth rates.

The sex ratio varies significantly across regions, often influenced by social and economic factors.

Population density correlates with overall population but shows regional clustering trends.

Age structure impacts dependency ratios and workforce composition.

Applications

Research on global demographic trends.

Educational use in data science, population studies, and policy analysis.

Foundation for predictive modeling and population forecasting.

Development of data visualization and storytelling skills.
